# Clinic-Application
This is a clinic application created by me and two colleagues. 
The App Records information directly through ArrayLists and saves directly to a text file. 
This is for learning purposes only. Do not use this code for your School projects, 
you have the internet and books at your disposal, use them.

This program manualy generated information. Since we are using ArrayLists once you exit the Application all the Data will 
be purged automatically.

-You have the ability to add, delete, and see patients on the list along with the use of Health insurance and billing of course.

-You can set up appointments and specify which doctor you would like to have the appointment with.
